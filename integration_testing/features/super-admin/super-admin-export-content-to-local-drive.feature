Feature: Super admin exports content to local drive
    Super admin needs to be able to export content channels from Kolibri server to local drives

  Background:
    Given there is <channel> content channel on the device
      And there is a <drive> local drive attached to the device 
      And I am signed in to Kolibri as super admin, or a user with device permissions to import content
      And I am on *Device > Channels* page

  Scenario: Export content channel to local drive
    When I click *Export*
    Then I see Kolibri searching for local drives
      And I see the *Select export destination* modal
    When I select the <drive> local drive
    Then I see the *Continue* button is active
    When I click the *Continue* button
    Then I see the list of channels present on the device
    When I click the *Select* button for the <channel> channel
    Then I see *Select content fromâ€¦* page
      And I see the list of topics for the <channel> channel
      And I see the total number and size of <channel> channel resources
      And I see 0 resources from <channel> channel are listed as *On your device*
    # Select/unselect all the topics
    When I check the *Select all* checkbox
    Then I see the checkboxes for all the topics are checked
      And I see the *Export* button is active
      And I see the values for *Content selected* increase
      And I see the value for *Drive space available* decreases (if the size of selected resources is close to 1GB)  
    When I uncheck the *Select all* checkbox
    Then I see the *Export* button is inactive
      And I see the values for *Content selected* is 0
      And I see the value for *Drive space available* increases to the initial state
    # Select/unselect one full topic    
    When I check the <topic> topic checkbox
    Then I see the *Export* button is active
      And I see the values for *Content selected* increase
      And I see the value for *Drive space available* decreases (if the size of selected resources is close to 1GB)
    When I uncheck the <topic> topic checkbox
    Then I see the *Export* button is inactive
      And I see the values for *Content selected* is 0
      And I see the value for *Drive space available* increases to the initial state
    # Select and import just one resource from a subtopic of a topic
    When I click the <topic> topic
    Then see the list of subtopics for the <topic> topic
    When I click the <subtopic> subtopic
    Then see the list of resources for the <subtopic> subtopic
    When I check the <resource> resource checkbox
    Then I see the *Export* button is active 
      And I see the *1 resource selected* flag for the <resource> resource
      And I see the values for *Content selected* increase
      And I see the value for *Drive space available* decreases (if the size of selected resources is close to 1GB)
    When I click the *Export* button
    Then I see *Device > Channels* page again
      And I see the blue progress bar with the percentage increasing 
    When the export process concludes
    Then I see the progress bar at 100%
      And I see the *Finished! Click "Close" button to see changes.* flag
      And I see the *Close* button
    When I click *Close* 
    Then I see the *Content* page is reloaded 
      And I open the <drive> local drive
      And I see the *KOLIBRI_DATA* folder on the <drive> local drive
      And I see the *content* subfolder inside 
      And I see the *databases* and *storage* subfolders inside the *content* folder
